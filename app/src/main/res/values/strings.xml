🌟 Welcome to the Star Detector App! 🌟
        \n
\nThis app helps you identify stars in the night sky using an image of the stars.
\nYou can upload your own image or capture one from the internet — and we’ll do the rest!
\n
\n🌌 If you love astronomy or just want to know🌌\n
        “What star is that?”\n
        this app is for you!


  \n
        \n
  \n🌟 What the App Does: 🌟
        \n
  \n🌌Detects stars in an image🌌
  \nThe app finds bright spots in your photo that are likely stars.
\n
  \n🌌Finds the real sky coordinates🌌
  \nIt uses Astrometry.net to figure out where in the sky each star is located (RA/DEC) .
\n
\n🌌Gets star names🌌
\nIt looks up each star’s name using the SIMBAD astronomical database.
\n
\n🌌Shows results and annotations🌌
\nYou’ll get a list of star names and their locations, and a version of the image labeled with this info.
