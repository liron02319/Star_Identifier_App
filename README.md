# Star_Identifier_App   

**Welcome to Star Identifier App Project !**  
- In This project we developed an app that processes an input image and by using an astronomical catalog classifies the detected objects and returns an image with the names of the stars.

## ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the Star Identifier App! ðŸŒŸ
- This app helps you identify stars in the night sky using an image of the stars. You can upload your own image or capture one from the internet â€” and weâ€™ll do the rest!

## âœ¨ What the App Does:
**1. Detects stars in an image**
- The app finds bright spots in your photo that are likely stars.

**2. Finds the real sky coordinates**
- It uses Astrometry.net to figure out where in the sky each star is located (RA/DEC).

**3. Gets star names**
- It looks up each starâ€™s name using the SIMBAD astronomical database.

**4. Shows results and annotations**
- Youâ€™ll get a list of star names and their locations, and a version of the image labeled with this info.

## ðŸ“¸ How to Use:
**There are two buttons:**   

- **Upload Image** â€“ Choose a photo of the stars from your device.
- **Use Online Image** â€“ Get an image from the internet automatically.

## ðŸ§  Behind the Scenes (for the curious):
- We detect bright points using computer vision (OpenCV).
- We convert pixel locations into sky coordinates.
- We ask Astrometry.net for accurate star mapping.
- Then we ask SIMBAD for the star names.
- Finally, we annotate your image and give you a downloadable text file with the results.

## Database
The SIMBAD database was used </br>
The database contains information about stars, astronomical objects and galaxy systems </br>
The database contains more than 10 million stars </br>
Updated and changed continuously </br>
After investigating the database only the information about the stars was taken and if the name of the star starts with "* alf" then the star has a more popular name then the other popular name is researched and the name is changed in the application. </br>
